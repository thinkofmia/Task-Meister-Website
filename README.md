## Types of files inside the Repository
Components 
- Components are the largest and most complex extensions of them all; they can be seen as mini-applications. Our Review Component is located here.

Modules
- Modules are more lightweight and flexible extensions used for page rendering. Most of the other display units such as the thumbs up buttons or the articles recommendations are located here.

Plugins
- Plugins are more advanced extensions and are in essence event handlers. This is where our Recommendation Engine runs its functions.

Templates
- A template is basically the design of the Joomla! powered website. Essentially the Look and Feel. Currently we are using our custom made Taskmeister template that comes with 4 themes.
